                <h5>The proliferation of the internet and the use of digital media 
                    has infiltrated every aspect of our lives. Painting today is no 
                    longer looked at within the confines of antiquated tradition but 
                    is instead seen and read within the contemporary moment of artistic 
                    production which includes the aid of digital tools and the influence 
                    of social media. Today, it is rare to find an artwork that is not 
                    somehow mediated by the internet which has the ability to proliferate, 
                    disperse and transmit images. But how does painting fit into all of 
                    this? If painting requires face-to-face interaction, how does it 
                    advocate for itself in the technological sphere?.

                <h5>
                    I created this painting with one of the oil painting techniques called glazing.
                    And created this glowy and reflecting work, which is hard to document and 
                    hard to present it on internet.
                    The intensions is to hope people can spend time and enjoy, observe it 
                    in-person, face to face, feel every details in the artwork.
